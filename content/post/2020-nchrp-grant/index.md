Dr. Jeong's research team has been awarded a two-year research grant from the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) for project 15-71: "Contingency Factors to Account for Risk in Early Construction Cost Estimates for Transportation Infrastructure Projects."

The project, launching July 1, 2020, aims to develop improved methods for estimating construction contingencies in early-stage transportation infrastructure projects. The research will help transportation agencies make more accurate cost estimates by accounting for project-specific risks.

Collaborators include Dr. KC Choi from Texas A&M and Dr. Doug Gransberg, bringing together expertise in construction cost estimation, risk management, and transportation infrastructure.

This research directly addresses a critical need in the transportation industry for better tools to estimate project costs during the scoping phase, when detailed designs are not yet available.
